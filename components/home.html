            <h1>Hi, I'm Anker</h1>
            <p>I currently work as a Software Engineer at Healthwise, a non-profit company located in Boise, Idaho. I get to work on apps that help keep people informed about their health.</p>
            <p>My adventure in software development began when I started studying web development at Brigham Young University-Idaho in 2015. In 2016 I got my first job as a web developer for a small company in Meridian, Idaho working mainly on front end development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
            <p>In October of 2017 I graduated from Boise CodeWorks and in December of the same year I started working as a software developer at AgentCubed in Boise, Idaho working on a CRM platform mainly with C#, SQL and JavaScript.</p>
            <p>In my spare time I work on side projects to learn new skills. Most of my side projects I build using Vue.js for the frontend, and Node.js with Express and MongoDB for the backend.</p>
