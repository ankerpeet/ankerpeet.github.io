            <h1><span class="underline">Hi,</span> <span class="underline">I'm</span> <span class="underline">Anker</span></h1>
            <p>I have spent most my career working as a full stack C# developer, but my true passion has always been in front-end development and working with Javascript.</p>
            <p>I currently work as a Software Engineer for a company called Genesys. I get to work mostly on the front-end using Angular.</p>
            <p>In my spare time I like to write and record my own music from my home studio. Music has always been my biggest hobby and one of the things I'm most passionate about.</p>
